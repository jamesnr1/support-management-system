## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES

### Worker Hour Tracking:

**Near Capacity (Watch closely):**
- Dhara: 40h (of 60h max) - ✅ SAFE
- Shar: 40h (of 60h max) - ✅ SAFE
- Arti: 40h (of 48h max) - ✅ SAFE
- Avani: 40h (of 48h max) - ✅ SAFE
- Happy: 40h (of 48h max) - ✅ SAFE
- Gaumit: 40h (of 45h max) - ✅ SAFE

**UNAVAILABLE:**
- ❌ **Anika** - Holiday Oct 3-13 (DO NOT SCHEDULE!)

### Week A vs Week B:
- **Week A (This Week):** Libby shares night support with Ace/Grace (2:3 ratio)
- Since you're NOT doing Libby this week, NO shared night support needed
- Focus on James (2:1), Grace (1:1), Ace (1:1), Milan (1:1)

### Next Steps:

1. **Add James shifts** (Most critical - 24/7 coverage with 2 workers)
   - Use the worker pairs I suggested
   - Morning/Afternoon/Night rotation

2. **Add Grace shifts** (Daily supports)
   - Simpler 1:1 ratio
   - Focus on weekday dailies

3. **You add Ace weekdays** (Per your note)
   - Weekend shifts can use Vaishalikumari & Shailee

4. **You add Milan weekdays** (Per your note)
   - Weekend shifts can use Rishit & Shailee
   - Use Chaynne for short shifts!

## 💡 SMART ALLOCATION TIPS

### For James (2:1 - Highest Need):
1. **Pair high-capacity workers** (Dhara+Arti, Shar+Avani, Happy+Gaumit)
2. **Consistent pairs** - same workers same shifts (builds routine)
3. **8-hour shifts** - easier to staff than 12-hour
4. **3 shift rotation** - morning/afternoon/night

### For Grace (1:1 - Daily Pattern):
1. **Consistent workers** - same person same day of week
2. **8-hour weekday shifts** - matches typical work day
3. **Different workers weekends** - give weekday workers breaks

### For Ace & Milan (1:1 - Lower Hours):
1. **Use workers with lower max hours** (Chi Ha 20h, Chaynne 7h)
2. **Good for workers who can't do full weeks**
3. **Flexible scheduling** - easier to adjust

## 🎯 TOTAL HOURS ESTIMATE

**If you follow this plan:**

### James: 
- 168 hours/week (24/7 x 2 workers = 336 worker-hours)

### Grace:

### Ace:
- ~16 hours/week (weekend only, you add weekdays)

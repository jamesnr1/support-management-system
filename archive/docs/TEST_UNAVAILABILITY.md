# Test Unavailability Feature

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **WorkerCard.jsx** - Visual Display
- ✅ Shows "🔴 UNAVAILABLE" in bold red when worker is unavailable
- ✅ Red border and red background when unavailable
- ✅ Shows "From: DD/MM/YY" and "To: DD/MM/YY" format
- ✅ Does NOT show weekly availability when unavailable
- ✅ Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds to catch updates
- ✅ Logs all availability/unavailability data to console

### 2. **ShiftForm.js** - Worker Filtering
- ✅ Fetches unavailability periods for all workers when form opens
- ✅ Filters out unavailable workers from selection dropdown
- ✅ Logs filtered workers to console: "⛔ Filtering out {name} - unavailable on {date}"
- ✅ Checks date ranges properly (from_date <= shift_date <= to_date)

### 3. **database.py** - Backend Logging
- ✅ Logs when unavailability periods are created
- ✅ Logs when unavailability periods are fetched
- ✅ Shows data being inserted and retrieved

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Make a Worker Unavailable

1. **Go to Admin tab**
2. **Click "Availability" button** for any worker (e.g., Anika)
3. **Scroll down to "Unavailable Periods"**
4. **Fill in:**
   - From Date: Today's date (e.g., 2025-10-03)
   - To Date: A few days from now (e.g., 2025-10-10)
   - Reason: Holiday
5. **Click "Save"**
6. **Check the worker card** - it should now show:
   ```
   🔴 UNAVAILABLE
   From: 03/10/25
   To: 10/10/25
   Holiday
   ```
   - Background should be reddish
   - Border should be red
   - NO weekly availability shown

### Test 2: Verify Worker is NOT Available for Shifts

1. **Go to any participant tab** (James, Libby, etc.)
2. **Click "Add Shift" for a date within the unavailability period**
3. **Open the Worker dropdown**
4. **The unavailable worker should NOT appear in the list**
5. **Open browser console (F12) and check for:**
   ```
   ⛔ Filtering out Anika - unavailable on 2025-10-03
   ```

### Test 3: Check Backend Logs

```bash
tail -f /tmp/backend.log | grep unavail
```

You should see:
```
📝 Inserting unavailability period: {...}
✅ Unavailability period created successfully: {...}
🔍 Fetching unavailability for worker_id: 117
📋 Data for worker 117: [{...}]
```

### Test 4: Verify Auto-Refresh

1. **Keep Admin tab open showing worker cards**
2. **In another tab, add an unavailability period**
3. **Within 5 seconds, the worker card should update** to show the red unavailability

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Changes saved successfully" but card doesn't update
- **Open browser console (F12)**
- Look for logs: `✅ Availability data for {name}:` and `🔴 Unavailability data for {name}:`
- If unavailability array is empty `[]`, the backend isn't saving properly
- Check backend logs: `tail -50 /tmp/backend.log`

### Issue: Worker still appears in shift allocation
- **Open browser console when creating a shift**
- Look for: `🔴 Worker {name} is unavailable on {date}`
- If not present, the ShiftForm isn't fetching unavailability
- Check network tab for `/api/workers/{id}/unavailability` requests

### Issue: Backend not responding
```bash
ps aux | grep "[p]ython.*server.py"
cd /Users/James/support-management-system/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python server.py
```

## ✨ Expected Behavior Summary

1. ✅ **When worker is unavailable**: Card shows red "UNAVAILABLE" message with dates, NO availability shown
2. ✅ **When worker is available**: Card shows weekly schedule (M - 09.00 - 17.00, etc.)
3. ✅ **During shift allocation**: Unavailable workers are automatically filtered out
4. ✅ **Real-time updates**: Cards refresh every 5 seconds
5. ✅ **Console logging**: All data fetching is logged for debugging

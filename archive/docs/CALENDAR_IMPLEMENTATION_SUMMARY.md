## üîß Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

```
RosteringSystem.js (Week A/B/Next A/Next B tabs)
    ‚Üì
CalendarAppointments.js (appears before participant cards)
    ‚Üì
    Fetches appointments via API
    ‚Üì
    Displays as grouped cards by date
```

### Backend Architecture

```
API Request: GET /api/calendar/appointments
    ‚Üì
server.py ‚Üí calendar_service.py
    ‚Üì
Google Calendar API (read-only)
    ‚Üì
Returns formatted appointments
    ‚Üì
Frontend displays
```

### Data Flow

1. User navigates to Week A, B, Next A, or Next B
2. `CalendarAppointments` component mounts
3. Calculates date range for the week
4. Calls `/api/calendar/appointments` with date range
5. Backend fetches from Google Calendar
6. Appointments returned and displayed as cards
7. User can refresh to get latest data

---

## üîë Key Changes from Initial Implementation

### ‚ùå Removed (from initial misunderstanding)
- Export shifts to calendar functionality
- ICS file generation
- Calendar event creation
- Interactive calendar view (react-big-calendar)
- Shift-to-event conversion

### ‚úÖ Correct Implementation
- **Read-only** calendar appointments viewer
- Displays existing events from Google Calendar
- No export or creation of events
- Simple card-based UI
- Names kept as-is (no nickname conversion)

---

## üì¶ Dependencies Installed

### Frontend
```json
{
  "@react-oauth/google": "^0.12.2",
  "gapi-script": "^1.2.0",
  "moment": "^2.30.1"
}
```

Note: `react-big-calendar` was installed but is not used in the final implementation.

### Backend
```
google-auth==2.41.1
google-auth-oauthlib==1.2.2
google-auth-httplib2==0.2.0
google-api-python-client==2.183.0
```

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### For End Users

1. Navigate to any week tab (Week A, B, Next A, or Next B)
2. If appointments exist for that week, you'll see them in a card at the top
3. Click **Refresh** to sync latest appointments
4. Click **Hide** to collapse the section if not needed
5. Click any appointment to open it in Google Calendar

### Setup Required (First Time)

1. Create Google Cloud project
2. Enable Google Calendar API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Download `client_secrets.json` to `/backend/`
5. Complete OAuth authorization flow

See `CALENDAR_APPOINTMENTS_GUIDE.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## üé® Visual Design

### Calendar Appointments Card
- Matches existing participant card styling
- Same color scheme and borders
- Responsive design
- Clean, minimal UI
- Auto-hides when empty

### Appointment Cards
- Title and time prominently displayed
- Description and location shown
- Attendee count indicator
- Google Calendar color bar on side
- Hover effect for clickable items

---

## ‚úÖ Naming Conventions

**Participant and Worker Names:**
- Uses names exactly as stored in database
- No nickname extraction
- No parentheses processing
- Example: "James" stays "James" (not converted to "Jimmy")

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Read-only access** - `calendar.readonly` scope only
- **Week-specific** - Only fetches appointments for selected week
- **No storage** - Appointments not saved in database
- **User-controlled** - Requires explicit OAuth authorization
- **Secure credentials** - OAuth handled server-side

---

## üìä API Endpoints

### GET `/api/calendar/appointments`
Fetch appointments for a date range.

**Parameters:**
- `startDate`: ISO 8601 date string
- `endDate`: ISO 8601 date string
- `weekType`: weekA/weekB/nextA/nextB

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "appointments": [...],
  "count": 5
}
```

### GET `/api/calendar/auth-url`
Get OAuth authorization URL.

### POST `/api/calendar/authorize`
Complete OAuth flow with authorization code.

---

## üß™ Testing

### To Test Locally

1. Start backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   python server.py
   ```

2. Start frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to Week A, B, Next A, or Next B
4. Look for Calendar Appointments card at the top

### Expected Behavior

- **With appointments**: Card shows with event details
- **Without appointments**: Card doesn't appear (auto-hidden)
- **Not configured**: No error, card simply doesn't appear
- **Refresh clicked**: Fetches latest from Google Calendar

---

## üìù Notes

1. **Auto-hide behavior**: The component won't show at all if there are no appointments, providing a clean UI when calendar is empty.

2. **Week date calculation**: Automatically calculates correct date range based on tab (Week A = previous week, etc.)

3. **No database storage**: Appointments are always fetched fresh from Google Calendar, never cached in the database.

4. **Name consistency**: All names (participants and workers) are now shown exactly as stored in the database.

5. **Optional feature**: Calendar appointments are completely optional - the system works fine if OAuth is not configured.

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. Only displays primary Google Calendar (not multiple calendars)
2. No filtering options (shows all appointments)
3. Limited to 100 appointments per week
4. Requires manual refresh (no auto-sync)
5. OAuth must be configured server-side

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. Multiple calendar support
2. Auto-refresh at intervals
3. Filter appointments by type/category
4. Conflict detection with shifts
5. Calendar selection dropdown
6. Offline mode with cached data

---

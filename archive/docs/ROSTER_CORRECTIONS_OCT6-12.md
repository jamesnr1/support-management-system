## üìù NOTES:

1. **Sandy's Role:** Should consistently work with Grace in morning transition periods (6am-8am)

2. **James 2:1 Ratio:** Needs 2 workers at all times, but Chaynne shifts were creating 3-worker overlaps

3. **Shift Continuity:** 8-hour shifts (6am-2pm) are more efficient than split shifts (6am-8am + 8am-2pm)

4. **Chaynne's Hours:** With both Thursday and Friday shifts removed, Chaynne will have 0 hours this week (was 8h)

5. **Worker Reassignments Needed:** Need to assign replacement workers for the hours Chaynne was covering, or redistribute

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è QUESTIONS FOR USER:

1. **Chaynne's Removal:** Should Chaynne get any hours this week, or remove completely?

2. **Sandy's Hours:** If Sandy moves to Grace only (7 days √ó 2h = 14h), who covers the James 6am-8am transition?

3. **Friday Night:** You mentioned "Rita 10pm shift" but Rita isn't in the roster. Did you mean a different worker or different day?

---

I'll now create the corrected roster with these fixes applied.

## üìä WORKER HOURS IMPACT:

| Worker | Current Hours | After Fixes | Change |
|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|

| **Mihir** | 32h | **26h** | -6h (Sun afternoon removed) |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è QUESTIONS BEFORE I PROCEED:

1. **Chaynne**: Remove completely (0 hours) or reassign to different shifts?

2. **James 6am-8am**: With Sandy moving to Grace, which 2 workers should cover James 6am-2pm on each day?

3. **Friday night Rita**: Can you clarify which worker you meant to remove/replace?

4. **Mihir hours**: Losing Sunday afternoon (6h), is this acceptable?

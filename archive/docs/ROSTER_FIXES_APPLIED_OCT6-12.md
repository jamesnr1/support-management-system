## ‚ùì STILL UNCLEAR:

### **Friday Night "Rita" Issue**

**Your request:** "Friday night please remove Rita 10pm shift and replace with Happy"

**Current roster (Friday Oct 10, 10pm-6am):**
- Taufique Raza (138) + Harshkumar (Happy) Modi (125)

**Problem:**
- Rita (Margerite Gjergji, ID 128) is NOT in the roster
- Happy (125) is ALREADY assigned to Friday night
- No change has been made to Friday night

**Please clarify:**
- Did you mean remove **Taufique** (not Rita)?
- Or was this for a different day/week?
- Or is there a Rita with a different ID?

# âœ… SHIFTS RESTORED!

## What Happened

When I fixed the ParticipantSchedule component to properly handle the `weekType` structure, the roster data file structure changed from:

**Old structure** (what backend expected):
```json
{
  "weekA": {
    "JAM001": { "2025-10-01": [...] }
  },
  "weekB": {
    "JAM001": { "2025-10-02": [...] }
  }
}
```

**New structure** (what frontend needs):
```json
{
  "JAM001": {
    "weekA": { "2025-10-01": [...] },
    "weekB": { "2025-10-02": [...] }
  }
}
```

The backend endpoints were still expecting the old structure, so when the frontend requested `/api/roster/weekB`, it got empty data.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Transformed Roster Data File
Converted the file from week-based to participant-based structure.

### 2. Updated GET Endpoint
```python
@api_router.get("/roster/{week_type}")
async def get_roster(week_type: str):
    # Extract week data from participant-based structure
    week_data = {}
    for participant_code, participant_data in ROSTER_DATA.items():
        if participant_code in ['admin', 'hours']:
            continue
        if isinstance(participant_data, dict) and week_type in participant_data:
            week_data[participant_code] = participant_data[week_type]
    return week_data
```

### 3. Updated POST Endpoint
```python
@api_router.post("/roster/{week_type}")
async def update_roster(week_type: str, roster_data: Dict[str, Any]):
    # Update participant-based structure
    for participant_code, dates_data in roster_data.items():
        if participant_code not in ROSTER_DATA:
            ROSTER_DATA[participant_code] = {}
        ROSTER_DATA[participant_code][week_type] = dates_data
    save_roster_data()
```

## Current Status

âœ… **Week A**: 5 participants, 47 shifts
âœ… **Week B**: 4 participants, 47 shifts  
âœ… **Next A**: 0 participants, 0 shifts (empty, as expected)
âœ… **Next B**: 0 participants, 0 shifts (empty, as expected)

**Total shifts preserved**: 94 across Week A and Week B

## What to Do Now

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Go to any participant tab** (James, Libby, Ace, Grace, Milan)
3. **Switch to Week B** - you should see all your shifts
4. **All operations work**: View, Add, Edit, Delete, Lock/Unlock

**Your shifts are safe and fully functional!** ðŸŽ‰

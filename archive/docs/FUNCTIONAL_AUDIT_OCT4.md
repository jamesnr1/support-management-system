## Critical Issues Found

### üîß FIXED
1. **ShiftForm initialization error** - React Hooks violation causing crash when adding shifts
   - Moved state declarations to top of component
   - Removed duplicate state declarations
   - Fixed in commit: 3dd263c

2. **CRITICAL: Data loss when saving shifts** - Would delete all participants except the one being edited
   - ParticipantSchedule was only sending ONE participant's data back to backend
   - Backend would replace entire roster with that one participant
   - Fixed by merging updated participant data with existing full roster before POST
   - Fixed in commit: 9867ee5

3. **CRITICAL: Incorrect worker hours in ShiftForm dropdown** - Would show much lower hours than actual
   - ShiftForm's calculateWorkerHours expected ALL participants' data
   - Was only receiving ONE participant's data
   - Result: Worker hours appeared as 5h instead of 30h, risking massive over-allocation
   - Fixed by passing fullRosterData prop through ParticipantSchedule to ShiftForm
   - Fixed in commit: a5613f9

4. **CRITICAL: Data loss in delete and lock shift functions** - Would delete all participants when deleting/locking ANY shift
   - handleDeleteShift and handleToggleLock were accessing rosterData[participant.code]
   - But rosterData is already participant-specific (no wrapper)
   - Result: Only sent partial data structure to onRosterUpdate
   - Would delete ALL other participants' shifts!
   - Fixed by correctly wrapping data structure before calling onRosterUpdate
   - Fixed in commit: e1f3930

### ‚ùå OPEN ISSUES
(None found during code audit - manual testing required)

---

## Audit Progress
- **Started:** October 4, 2025
- **Code Review:** COMPLETE
- **Critical Bugs Found:** 4 (all fixed)
- **Manual Testing:** REQUIRED before roster creation

---

## 8. WHAT TO TEST NOW

### üéØ Critical Path Testing (15 minutes)

Test these workflows to verify the fixes work:

**1. Add a shift in Roster tab:**
- Go to Roster tab
- Turn on Edit Mode
- Click "+" to add a shift to James
- Select workers, times, location
- Save
- ‚úÖ CHECK: All other participants still have their shifts (not deleted)
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Worker hours in dropdown are accurate (e.g., 30h not 5h)

**2. Edit an existing shift:**
- Click "Edit" on any shift
- Change time or worker
- Save
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Only that shift changed, others unchanged

**3. Delete a shift:**
- Click "Delete" on a shift
- Confirm deletion
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Only that shift deleted, all others remain

**4. Lock/Unlock a shift:**
- Click "Lock" on a shift
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Shift is locked (can't edit/delete)
- Click "Unlock"
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Can now edit/delete again
- ‚úÖ CHECK: All other participants' shifts still exist

**5. Copy to Planner:**
- In Roster tab, click "Copy to Planner"
- Switch to Planner tab
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Data copied correctly
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Week type flipped (A‚ÜíB or B‚ÜíA)

**6. Add shift in Planner:**
- In Planner tab, add a shift
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Shift saves correctly
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Roster tab data unchanged

**7. Hours Tab:**
- Go to Hours tab
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Hours display correctly
- Go back to Roster, add a shift
- Go to Hours tab
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Hours updated with new shift

**8. Worker Availability:**
- Go to Admin tab
- Set a worker unavailable for a date
- Go to Roster, try to add shift on that date
- ‚úÖ CHECK: Unavailable worker not shown or marked

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Still Break

Based on the audit, these areas were NOT fully tested:
- Export Payroll/Shifts functions (should work, but verify CSV output)
- Calendar integration (separate system, unlikely to affect roster)
- Telegram messaging (separate system)
- AI Chat (separate system)
- Week pattern toggle in Planner (logic looks correct but not tested)

---

## CONCLUSION

**Status: READY FOR MANUAL TESTING**

‚úÖ **4 Critical Bugs Fixed:**
1. ShiftForm crash (React Hooks)
2. Data loss on shift save
3. Incorrect worker hours  
4. Data loss on delete/lock

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the critical path testing above (15 min)
2. If all tests pass ‚Üí Safe to create roster
3. If anything fails ‚Üí Report issue for immediate fix

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Before Fixes:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Would lose all data on any shift operation
- **After Fixes:** üü¢ LOW - Core data operations should work correctly

- **Date:** Sunday, October 5, 2025
- **Time:** 22:00 (10pm) → 06:00 (6am Monday morning)

## ✅ THE FIX:

Changed Monday Oct 6 overnight shift to match the Sunday night roster:

### **CORRECTED Monday Oct 6 Overnight Shift:**
- **Time:** 22:00 → 06:00
- **Workers:** **Hamza + Sanjay** ✅
- **Note:** "Continues from Sunday night Oct 5"

- **Before:** 40 hours
- **After:** 48 hours (+8 hours)

### **Mayu (129):**
- **Before:** 40 hours
- **After:** 32 hours (-8 hours)

# STRICT RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE

## File Management
- NEVER create new files unless explicitly asked
- ALWAYS update existing files instead of duplicating
- DO NOT create backup files (_old, _new, _backup, etc.)
- DO NOT create multiple versions (v1, v2, FINAL, COMPLETE, etc.)

## Code Changes
- MAXIMUM 1 file change per request unless user says otherwise
- ALWAYS show full file diff, never truncate
- NO placeholder comments like "// rest of code stays same"
- UPDATE existing functions, don't create duplicates

## Architecture
- CSV files are intentional for payroll/reports
- Supabase is for reference data (workers, participants)
- Frontend validation uses shiftValidation.js
- Backend validation_rules.py exists but is separate

## Before Making Changes
1. Check if file already exists
2. Check if function already exists
3. Update existing code, don't duplicate

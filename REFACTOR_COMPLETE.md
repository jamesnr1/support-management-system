# ✅ Roster/Planner Refactor - COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully refactored from 6-tab system (Week A/B, Next A/B, Admin, Hours) to streamlined 4-tab system (Roster, Planner, Admin, Hours).

---

## What Changed

### 🎯 **Tab Structure**
**Before:** Week A | Week B | Next A | Next B | Admin | Hours  
**After:** Roster | Planner | Admin | Hours

### 📊 **Data Structure**
```json
// Old structure
{
  "weekA": { "JAM001": {...}, "LIB001": {...} },
  "weekB": { "JAM001": {...}, "LIB001": {...} },
  "nextA": { ... },
  "nextB": { ... }
}

// New structure
{
  "roster": {
    "week_type": "weekB",
    "start_date": "2025-09-29",
    "end_date": "2025-10-05",
    "data": { "JAM001": {...}, "LIB001": {...} }
  },
  "planner": {
    "week_type": "weekA",
    "start_date": "",
    "end_date": "",
    "data": { ... }
  }
}
```

### 🔄 **Week Type Logic**
- **Week A** = Grace at James's place, Ace at Libby's (hours tracking pattern A)
- **Week B** = Grace at Libby's place, Ace at James's (hours tracking pattern B)
- **Copy Function** automatically flips week_type (A→B or B→A)
- **Export Functions** use week_type to apply correct NDIS codes and locations

---

## 🛠️ Technical Changes

### Backend (`server.py`)
1. **New Endpoints:**
   - `POST /api/roster/copy_to_planner` - Copy roster to planner with week_type flip
   - `POST /api/roster/transition_to_roster` - Move planner to roster (Sunday automation)

2. **Updated Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/roster/roster` - Returns current roster with metadata
   - `GET /api/roster/planner` - Returns planner with metadata
   - `POST /api/roster/{roster|planner}` - Update roster/planner

3. **Data Migration:**
   - Script: `backend/migrate_to_roster_planner.py`
   - Mapped: weekB → roster, nextA → planner
   - Backup: `roster_data.json.backup_*`

### Frontend (`RosteringSystem.js`, `HoursTracker.js`)
1. **Tab Navigation:** Updated to 4 tabs
2. **Data Access:** Changed from `rosterData[weekA]` to `rosterData.roster.data`
3. **Copy Function:** Now calls backend endpoint (no client-side date logic)
4. **Sunday Automation:** Calls `/transition_to_roster` endpoint
5. **Hours Tracker:** Maps roster/planner data to weekA/weekB based on week_type

---

## 🎮 **User Experience**

### Roster Tab (Current Week)
- Shows active roster with current week_type displayed
- **Buttons:** Edit Mode, Copy to Planner, Export Payroll, Export Shifts
- **Copy to Planner** automatically:
  1. Duplicates all shifts to planner
  2. Flips week_type (e.g., weekB → weekA)
  3. Updates Ace/Grace locations
  4. Switches to Planner tab

### Planner Tab (Future Week)
- For planning next week's roster
- Same edit capabilities as Roster
- **Buttons:** Edit Mode, Export Payroll, Export Shifts
- Can be edited without affecting current roster

### Sunday 3 AM Automation
- Planner automatically moves to Roster
- Week_type is preserved (e.g., weekA stays weekA)
- Planner cleared for new planning
- Hours tracking updates based on new week_type

---

## 📂 **Files Modified**
- ✅ `backend/server.py` - New endpoints added
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/RosteringSystem.js` - Tab structure updated
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/HoursTracker.js` - Data access updated
- ✅ `backend/migrate_to_roster_planner.py` - Migration script
- ✅ `backend/roster_data.json` - New structure applied

## 🔐 **Safety Measures**
- ✅ All backups created before migration
- ✅ Feature branch: `feature/current-planning-tabs`
- ✅ Original data preserved in backups
- ✅ Revert available: `git checkout main`

---

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Navigate between Roster/Planner/Admin/Hours tabs
- [ ] View shifts in Roster tab (should show current weekB)
- [ ] Click "Copy to Planner" - should copy and flip week_type
- [ ] View shifts in Planner tab (should show copied data)
- [ ] Edit shifts in both Roster and Planner (verify independence)
- [ ] Export payroll from both tabs (verify week_type affects export)
- [ ] Check Hours tab (should calculate using week_type logic)
- [ ] Verify Admin tab still works

---

## 🔄 **Rollback Instructions**
If needed, revert to old system:
```bash
cd /Users/James/support-management-system
git checkout main
# Restart backend
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python server.py
```

---

## 📝 **Next Steps**
1. **Test the refactor** in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Verify copy function** works as expected
3. **Check export functionality** uses correct week_type
4. **Test hours tracking** still calculates correctly
5. **Merge to main** when satisfied: `git checkout main && git merge feature/current-planning-tabs`

---

## ✨ **Benefits**
- ✅ Simpler navigation (4 tabs instead of 6)
- ✅ Clearer intent (Roster = current, Planner = future)
- ✅ Automatic week_type management
- ✅ No manual date tracking needed
- ✅ Reduced confusion about which week is which
- ✅ Preserved all existing functionality

**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing  
**Branch:** `feature/current-planning-tabs`

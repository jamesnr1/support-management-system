# ü§ñ AI GUIDE: Creating Rosters

**READ THIS BEFORE CREATING ANY ROSTER!**

This guide exists because AI (including me) has repeatedly made the same mistakes. Follow this checklist religiously.

---

## üìã BEFORE YOU START

### Step 1: Read Requirements File
```bash
cat PARTICIPANT_REQUIREMENTS.json
```

**DO NOT TRUST YOUR MEMORY. READ THE FILE EVERY TIME.**

### Step 2: Run Validation After Creation
```bash
cd backend
python3 validate_roster_requirements.py
```

## üö® COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ‚ùå Mistake #1: Grace's Hours
**WRONG:** Giving Grace 12h weekdays (8am-8pm)
**RIGHT:** 
- **Weekdays:** 8.5h = 6.5h (6am-8pm window) + **2h EVENING (8pm-10pm)** ‚Üê DON'T FORGET THIS!
- **Saturday:** 16h (6am-10pm)
- **Sunday:** 16h (6am-10pm)

### ‚ùå Mistake #2: Milan Weekend
**WRONG:** One 6-hour shift
**RIGHT:** TWO separate 3-hour shifts (self-care + community), can be same worker

### ‚ùå Mistake #3: 10-Hour Rest
**WRONG:** Worker finishes night shift 6am, starts next shift 8am
**RIGHT:** Must have 10 hours rest (can't work before 4pm next day)

### ‚ùå Mistake #4: Not Checking Female Requirement
**WRONG:** Assigning male workers to Grace
**RIGHT:** Grace MUST have female workers only

### ‚ùå Mistake #5: Forgetting Special Assignments
- Sandy: Early morning 6-8am shifts
- Chaynne: Specific Tue 9-1pm + Fri 12-4pm
- Mihir: EXACTLY 24 hours (not ~24, EXACTLY 24)

6. **RUN** validation script
7. **FIX** all errors
8. **PRESENT** to user with hour breakdown

## üí° WHEN IN DOUBT

- Check `PARTICIPANT_REQUIREMENTS.json` first
- Ask user to clarify before guessing
- Run validation script before committing
- Show calculations explicitly

## üéØ EXAMPLE: Grace Weekday

**CORRECT BREAKDOWN:**
```
Monday:
- 10:00-16:30 (6.5h daytime, Arti)
- 20:00-22:00 (2h evening, Sapana)  ‚Üê DON'T FORGET!
Total: 8.5h ‚úÖ
```

**WRONG:**
```
Monday:
- 08:00-14:00 (6h, Arti)
- 14:00-20:00 (6h, Sapana)
Total: 12h ‚ùå (Missing evening, too many hours)
```

---

## üìä VALIDATION COMMAND

After creating roster:
```bash
cd backend
python3 validate_roster_requirements.py
```

Fix ALL errors before presenting to user!

**Remember: The requirements file is the source of truth. Your memory is not.**

## Critical Issues Found

### üîß FIXED
1. **ShiftForm initialization error** - React Hooks violation causing crash when adding shifts
   - Moved state declarations to top of component
   - Removed duplicate state declarations
   - Fixed in commit: 3dd263c

2. **CRITICAL: Data loss when saving shifts** - Would delete all participants except the one being edited
   - ParticipantSchedule was only sending ONE participant's data back to backend
   - Backend would replace entire roster with that one participant
   - Fixed by merging updated participant data with existing full roster before POST
   - Fixed in commit: 9867ee5

3. **CRITICAL: Incorrect worker hours in ShiftForm dropdown** - Would show much lower hours than actual
   - ShiftForm's calculateWorkerHours expected ALL participants' data
   - Was only receiving ONE participant's data
   - Result: Worker hours appeared as 5h instead of 30h, risking massive over-allocation
   - Fixed by passing fullRosterData prop through ParticipantSchedule to ShiftForm
   - Fixed in commit: a5613f9

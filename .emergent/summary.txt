The AI engineer was tasked with developing a rostering system, leveraging existing problematic files and continuous user feedback. The core challenge was translating detailed UI/UX specifications, often presented via  and screenshots, into a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. The AI repeatedly struggled with accurately implementing these visual and functional requirements. Recurring issues included misinterpreting the dark theme, inconsistent component placement (e.g., Add Shift buttons, unavailability forms), and persistent failures in key functionalities like Copy Template and the Admin tab. The user expressed significant frustration over the AI's inefficiency, constant re-work, and occasional removal of critical features without consent. Debugging involved reviewing logs, direct API testing, and using a troubleshoot agent, often revealing data handling errors or JSX syntax issues. The trajectory concludes with the AI acknowledging its failures and focusing on refining UI elements and consolidating availability features, with several core problems still unresolved.

The primary goal is to create a working rostering system, moving from initial HTML/JS/SQL logic to a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. Core features include worker/participant/shift management, advanced scheduling (availability, conflict detection), and hours tracking. UI/UX is critical, demanding strict adherence to  for a dark, eye-friendly theme, specific layout, and component styling. Inline shift creation, detailed participant headers (, ), compact shift info (shift number, time, type, workers/notes), and accurate Copy Template (Week A/B to Next A/B) and Export (CSV) functionalities are required. The Hours tracking should be a tab, reflecting specific hour categories via CSV upload/export. The Admin tab needs robust worker management with integrated unavailability (within an availability popup modal), and smaller worker cards.

-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React for frontend, FastAPI for backend.
-   **Database:** MongoDB (using  and ).
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, direct CSS application from .
-   **Frontend Data Management:** React Query for data fetching, component state.
-   **API Integration:**  for backend calls,  prefix, environment variables ().

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure:


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application entry point, defines API routes and connects to MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup for MongoDB connection, worker/participant/shift management endpoints, integration of JavaScript logic for scheduling and hours tracking. Verified  and  endpoints.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Handles the database connection and MongoDB operations.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to use  for MongoDB connection and CRUD operations for , , and  collections.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component, handles routing and overall application layout.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented main navigation tabs (Week A, B, Next A, B, Admin, Hours). Initially disabled Copy to Template, Export, Hours, later re-enabled, and finally moved Hours to a dedicated tab after Admin. Removed a horizontal line.
-   ** / **:
    -   **Summary**: Global and component-specific CSS styling, primarily using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications to align with  for a dark theme, participant cards, shift forms, buttons, removing amber lines, and adding hour category styling in .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages the main rostering display, including participants and their schedules.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  and . Implemented week navigation. Copy Template logic (fetching Week A/B, posting to Next A/B) was repeatedly debugged for functionality and API calls. Export implemented. Debugging for loading states (participants, workers, locations) and React Query.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays individual participant information and contains shift slots.
    -   **Changes**: Refined display, updated participant header to show , .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Form for creating and editing shifts.
    -   **Changes**: Transformed from a modal to an inline form with dropdowns. Reordered fields. Button sizing made consistent across Save, Edit, Delete, Cancel.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Admin interface for managing support workers.
    -   **Changes**: Repeatedly modified for Set Unavailability functionality, moving from inline to a popup modal within the Availability section. Involved fixing numerous runtime and JSX syntax errors, removing unused state/mutations/functions, and refining button layouts. A key goal is to make worker cards smaller.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Component for tracking worker hours.
    -   **Changes**: Revamped to use specific hour category codes (SCWD, CPWD, etc.) and a layout matching  / . CSV upload and export functionality for participant plans restored and refined. Fixed an  in a non-async function. Removed format description.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays shifts for a participant for a given week.
    -   **Changes**: Logic for Add Shift button visibility in edit mode. / functions refined to work inline. Shift number placement adjusted multiple times (currently after shift type/ratio). Worker icon placement (before name). Notes placement (same line as workers). Fixed JSX syntax errors.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Copy Template functionality**: Still reported by the user as not working on the frontend.
-   **Admin Layout and Unavailability**: The unavailability feature needs to be correctly integrated *within* the availability popup modal, with proper sizing for the reason text box.
-   **Worker Card Sizing**: Make worker cards smaller and more compact as per user request.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was attempting to address the user's frustration regarding several persistent issues. The user reiterated that the Copy Template functionality was still not working, the Admin tab's availability window was incorrectly sized, and the unavailability feature was still not integrated into the availability modal as a sub-section but rather a separate button. The user also explicitly requested that the worker cards in the Admin tab be made smaller and more compact to improve scannability for a large number of workers.

The AI acknowledged these points and planned to integrate unavailable dates inside the availability popup, remove the separate Set Unavailable button, fix the modal size, and make worker cards smaller. The very last action recorded in the trajectory was an edit that was successful, followed by the AI's internal thought, Now let me make the worker cards smaller and more compact:. This indicates the AI was actively working on, or had just completed, an edit to reduce the size of worker cards, as part of the broader plan to address the Admin tab layout and functionality.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue making worker cards smaller and more compact, and integrate unavailability into the availability modal with correct sizing.

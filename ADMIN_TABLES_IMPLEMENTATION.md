   - ✅ Worker Details table appears SECOND

2. **Enhanced Availability & Unavailability Table**
   - Shows **3 columns**: Worker Name | Weekly Availability | Unavailable Periods

     - "✓ Available" if no unavailable periods
     - **🔴 UNAVAILABLE NOW** indicator for workers currently in an unavailable period
     - **Red highlighting** for active unavailable periods

3. **Basic Filter Functionality**
   - Search bar to filter workers by name
   - Shows count: "Showing X of Y workers"

## 🎯 Key Features

### Availability Logic (Ongoing/Weekly)
- Availability is **weekly recurring** (doesn't change unless worker updates it)
- Worker selects available days and time ranges
- This availability applies **every week** until changed
- Only workers with matching availability for shift day/time should appear when allocating shifts

### Unavailability Logic (Date Range)
- Unavailability is **temporary** with specific From and To dates
- When the unavailability period ends, worker **automatically becomes available again**
- Their **original weekly availability** resumes
- System shows "UNAVAILABLE NOW" for workers currently in an unavailable period

### Current Status Indicators
- **🔴 UNAVAILABLE NOW** - Worker is currently in an unavailable period
- **Red border** around active unavailable period cards
- **Green "✓ Available"** - Worker has no current or upcoming unavailable periods

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test 1: View Availability Table
1. Navigate to Admin tab
2. Scroll down past the worker cards
3. **Verify**: Availability & Unavailability table appears FIRST
4. **Check**: Each worker shows their weekly availability (days and times)
5. **Check**: Unavailable periods show From/To dates

### Test 2: Check Anika's Unavailability
**Issue Reported**: "Anika is having 3 unavailable and it is not even saying unavailable"

1. Find Anika in the Availability table
2. **Expected**:
   - If she has unavailable periods, they should show in the "Unavailable Periods" column
   - Each period should show: Reason, From date, To date, Duration
   - If currently in an unavailable period, should show "🔴 UNAVAILABLE NOW" next to her name
   - Active periods should have red highlighting

3. **If data shows but says "Available"**:
   - Check if the unavailable periods are in the **past** (system only shows current and future)
   - Check if the From/To dates are correctly set in the database

### Test 3: Weekly Availability Display
1. Check a worker who has set their availability
2. **Expected**: See badges like "Monday 09:00 - 17:00", "Tuesday 09:00 - 17:00", etc.
3. **Check**: Days worker is NOT available should not appear

4. Check a worker who hasn't set availability
5. **Expected**: Should show "No availability set"

### Test 4: Filter Functionality
1. Type a worker's name in the search box
2. **Verify**: Only matching workers appear in:
   - Worker cards section
   - Availability table
   - Worker Details table
3. **Verify**: Counter updates (e.g., "Showing 1 of 6 workers")

### Test 5: Unavailability Period Expiry
1. Add an unavailability period for a worker (e.g., Holiday from today to tomorrow)
2. **Verify**: Period appears in the table with "UNAVAILABLE NOW" indicator
3. After the To date passes:
   - Period should disappear from table (or move to past periods if showing history)
   - Worker should show "✓ Available" again
   - Worker's weekly availability should apply normally

## 🔍 Debugging Anika's Issue

To investigate why Anika shows unavailable periods but not the status:

### Check 1: Database Inspection
```sql
-- Run this in your database to see Anika's unavailability
SELECT * FROM unavailability WHERE worker_id = (
  SELECT id FROM workers WHERE full_name LIKE '%Anika%'
);
```

Expected columns:
- `id`
- `worker_id`
- `from_date`
- `to_date`
- `reason`

### Check 2: Date Validation
- Are the dates in the correct format? (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Is `from_date` before `to_date`?
- Are the dates in the **future** or **current**? (Past dates are filtered out)

### Check 3: Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Admin tab
3. Check Console for errors like:
   - "Error fetching data for Anika"
   - Date parsing errors
   - Network errors

### Check 4: Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools → Network tab
2. Refresh the Admin page
3. Look for requests to:
   - `/api/workers/{worker_id}/availability`
   - `/api/workers/{worker_id}/unavailability`
4. Click on Anika's request and check:
   - Status: Should be 200 OK
   - Response: Should contain array of unavailability periods
   - Preview the data structure

## 📊 Expected Data Flow

### When Admin Page Loads:
1. Fetches list of workers
2. For each worker, fetches:
   - Weekly availability rules
   - Unavailability periods
3. Filters out **past** unavailable periods
4. Calculates if worker is **currently** unavailable
5. Displays in table with proper indicators

### When Allocating Shifts:
1. System should check worker's weekly availability
2. Check day of week matches available day
3. Check shift time overlaps with available time range
4. Check worker is NOT in an unavailable period for that date
5. Only show eligible workers for selection

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Better Debugging:
1. Add a "Show Past Unavailability" toggle to see historical periods
2. Add backend logging for unavailability queries
3. Add a "Status" column in Worker Details table showing "Available" or "Unavailable"

### For Better UX:
1. Color-code workers in the worker cards:
   - Green border = Available
   - Red border = Currently unavailable
2. Add tooltips explaining availability vs unavailability
3. Show "Returns on [date]" for currently unavailable workers

### For Performance (30-40 workers):
- Current implementation should handle 30-40 workers efficiently
- All data fetched in parallel using `Promise.all`
- No need for pagination at this scale
- Filter is client-side (fast enough for <100 workers)

---

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Debug Steps:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check backend logs: `tail -f backend/server.log`
4. Test API endpoint directly:
   ```bash
   # Get Anika's worker ID first
   curl http://localhost:8001/api/workers
   
   # Then get her unavailability
   curl http://localhost:8001/api/workers/{anika_id}/unavailability
   ```

### Common Issues:
- **Empty response**: Worker has no unavailability in database
- **Past dates**: Periods are filtered out if already ended
- **Wrong format**: Dates not in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Timezone issues**: Check if dates are being converted incorrectly

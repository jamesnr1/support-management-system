# Live Hours Tally Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Participant Order Fix ✅
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/RosteringSystem.js`
- **Change**: Modified participant rendering to show in custom order: James, Libby, Ace, Grace, Milan
- **Implementation**: Added sorting logic using participant codes ['JAM001', 'LIB001', 'ACE001', 'GRA001', 'MIL001']

### 2. Live Hours Tally ✅
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/ShiftForm.js`
- **Purpose**: Show worker hours next to their names during shift allocation
- **Features**:
  - Calculates total hours for each worker in the current week
  - Displays hours next to worker names in dropdown: "Worker Name (12.5h)"
  - Color coding: Green (<30h), Yellow (30-35h), Red (>35h)
  - Real-time updates as you add/edit shifts

### 3. Component Integration ✅
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/ParticipantSchedule.js`
- **Change**: Added `weekType` and `rosterData` props to ShiftForm calls
- **Purpose**: Enables hours calculation for the current week being edited

## How It Works

1. **During Shift Creation/Editing**: When you open a shift form, each worker in the dropdown shows their current hours
2. **Real-time Updates**: Hours are calculated from the current roster data for the active week
3. **Visual Feedback**: Color coding helps identify workers approaching their limits
4. **Week-specific**: Only shows hours for the week you're currently editing (Week A, Week B, Next A, Next B)

## Usage

1. Navigate to any week tab (Week A, Week B, Next A, Next B)
2. Click "+" to add a shift or edit an existing shift
3. In the worker selection dropdowns, you'll see: "Worker Name (current_hours)"
4. Use this information to balance workload across workers

## Benefits

- **Better allocation decisions**: See who has capacity before assigning shifts
- **Prevent overwork**: Visual warnings when workers approach limits
- **Real-time feedback**: Hours update immediately as you make changes
- **Week-specific view**: Focus on the week you're currently planning

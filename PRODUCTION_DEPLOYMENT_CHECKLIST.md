# 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ **Pre-Deployment Verification**

### **Database & Data**
- [x] ✅ Availability data access verified (using `availability_rule` table)
- [x] ✅ Database schema scripts created (`fix_deleted_at_columns.sql`, `remove_unused_tables.sql`)
- [x] ✅ All database operations tested and working
- [x] ✅ Data integrity verified (4 workers, 5 participants, 7 availability rules)

### **Code Quality**
- [x] ✅ Debug statements removed from production code
- [x] ✅ Console statements cleaned from frontend
- [x] ✅ N+1 query problems fixed with batch loading
- [x] ✅ Response caching implemented (5-minute cache for roster, 1-minute for workers)
- [x] ✅ Modular architecture implemented (server.py split into focused routes)

### **Testing**
- [x] ✅ Unit tests created (database operations, validation logic)
- [x] ✅ Integration tests created (API endpoints)
- [x] ✅ Frontend component tests created (React components)
- [x] ✅ End-to-end tests created (user workflows)
- [x] ✅ Test infrastructure configured (pytest, Jest)

### **Performance**
- [x] ✅ Batch loading implemented for availability rules
- [x] ✅ Response caching configured
- [x] ✅ Database queries optimized
- [x] ✅ Large component files split for better performance

### **Security**
- [x] ✅ Rate limiting configured
- [x] ✅ CORS properly configured
- [x] ✅ Input validation implemented
- [x] ✅ Error handling standardized

## 🔧 **Deployment Steps**

### **1. Database Setup**
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- 1. Fix missing deleted_at columns
\i backend/scripts/fix_deleted_at_columns.sql

-- 2. Remove unused tables
\i backend/scripts/remove_unused_tables.sql
```

### **2. Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Backend environment variables
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Optional for caching
```

### **3. Dependencies Installation**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
```

### **4. Testing**
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

### **5. Build & Deploy**
```bash
# Frontend build
cd frontend
npm run build

# Backend deployment
cd backend
# Deploy using your preferred method (Docker, cloud platform, etc.)
```

## 📊 **Performance Benchmarks**

### **Expected Performance**
- **API Response Times:** < 500ms for cached endpoints, < 1s for database queries
- **Database Queries:** 1 query instead of N queries (batch loading)
- **Frontend Load Time:** < 2s initial load, < 500ms for subsequent navigation
- **Cache Hit Rate:** > 80% for roster and worker endpoints

### **Monitoring Points**
- Database query performance
- API response times
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates
- User session metrics

## 🛡️ **Security Checklist**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- [x] ✅ Admin-only endpoints protected
- [x] ✅ Rate limiting configured (30/min for reads, 5/min for writes)
- [x] ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
- [x] ✅ SQL injection protection (using Supabase client)

### **Data Protection**
- [x] ✅ Sensitive data (phone, telegram) hidden for non-admin users
- [x] ✅ CORS configured for production domains
- [x] ✅ Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### **Infrastructure**
- [x] ✅ HTTPS enforced in production
- [x] ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
